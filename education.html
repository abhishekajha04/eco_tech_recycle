            <h2 class="name"> Harmful effects of e-waste <br> on humans
            </h2>
            <p class="description">As mentioned electronic waste contains toxic components that are dangerous 
              to human health such as mercury, lead, cadmium, polybrominated flames retardants, barium and lithium.
              The negetive health effects of these toxics on human includes brain, heart, liver, kidney, skeleton system 
              damages. It can also considerebly affect the nervous and reproductive system of human bodies, leading to diseases
              and birth defects.

            <h2 class="name">Harmful effects of e-waste <br> on air bodies
            </h2>
            <p class="description">Contamination in the air occurs when e-waste is informally disposed of by
               dismantling, shredding, or melting the materials, releasing dust particles or toxins, such as dioxins, 
               into the environment that cause air pollution and damage respiratory health.Chronic diseases and cancers are 
               at a higher risk to occur when burning e-waste because it also releases fine particles, which can travel thousands of 
               miles, creating numerous negative health risks to humans and animals.</p>

            <h2 class="name">Harmful effects of e-waste <br> on water bodies
            </h2>
            <p class="description">When these heavy metals reach groundwater, they eventually make their way into 
              ponds, streams, rivers and lakes. Through these pathways, acidification and toxification are created in the 
              water, which is unsafe for animals, plants and communities even if they are miles away from a recycling site.
              Acidification can kill marine and freshwater organisms, disturb biodiversity and harm ecosystems. If acidification
               is present in water supplies, it can damage ecosystems to the point where recovery is questionable, if not impossible.</p>
